    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I just released the beta version of a new open-source project I put together
over the weekend. <a href="https://github.com/bradurani/Gitfile">Gitfile</a> is a
lightweight package manager for installing and updating software from git repos.
It&rsquo;s great for installing odd things that live on GitHub and can&rsquo;t be installed
with typical package managers.
I built it because there are several things I wanted to include with my <a href="https://github.com/bradurani/bradrc">dotfiles</a>
that can&rsquo;t be installed with brew, gem, npm, pip or any other common package
managers. They&rsquo;re things like <a href="https://github.com/thewtex/tmux-mem-cpu-load">tmux plugins</a>, <a href="https://github.com/tpope/rbenv-ctags">rbenv plugins</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/olivierverdier/zsh-git-prompt">zsh plugins</a> that I want to
install automatically and update with a single command.<br/>
Gitfile is written in <a href="" title="https://golang.org/">Go</a> and I&rsquo;d love contributions and
⭐️s. This was my first experience programming in Go. I haven&rsquo;t been that
interested in learning it because I&rsquo;m so fond of the newer functional languages,
but this type of cross-platform command line app seemed like the right use case.
I got started in no time, and became productive more quickly than I ever have
with any other language. For me, it&rsquo;s a limited use case tool because it&rsquo;s
missing a lot of things I rely on when building big production apps. For
utilities like this though, I&rsquo;d use it again.</p>
